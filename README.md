# Distributed-Learning

Training a machine learning model is a very time-consuming task. As datasets size increases, it becomes very hard to train models within a limited time frame. To solve this type of problem, distributed training approaches are used. Using distributed training, we can train very large models and speed up training time. Tensorflow provides a high-end API to train your models in a distributed way with minimal code changes.
